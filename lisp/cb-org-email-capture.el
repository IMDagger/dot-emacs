;;; Commentary:

;; Capture emails in a specified maildir folder with org-mode.

;;; Configuration:

;; Create an IMAP folder called 'org' and create a server-side rule to move messages
;; from your own address into that folder.
;;
;; Configure your offlineimaprc (or whatever you use to manage your maildir) to
;; sync that folder.
;;
;; This package works by associating message subjects with capture
;; templates. You should customise `org-capture-templates' to include actions
;; with the at least the following titles:
;;
;; * Todo
;; * Note
;; * Link
;; * Diary
;;
;; Furthermore, you should make an entry in `org-agenda-custom-commands' called
;; 'email' that should email a copy of your agenda to yourself.

;;; Usage:

;;
;; Once configured, you can send yourself an email and this package will perform
;; an appropriate action:
;;
;; * Messages whose body contains a link will be captured as a link.
;;
;; * Messages with 'diary' as the subject will be added to the diary.
;;
;; * Messages with 'agenda' as the subject will invoke a special 'Email'
;;   action. I have this configured to mail me a formatted copy of my agenda for
;;   the day.
;;
;; * In any other case, the message will be inserted at the appropriate tree for
;;   its capture template. If a capture template cannot be found, it will be
;;   inserted as a note using the 'Note' template.
;;
;; A message may contain special directives. They occur at the start of any line
;; and take the form <letter><space><args...>.
;;
;; * Schedule (s): The line is read as a time-stamp specification.
;;
;; * Deadline (d): The line is read as a time-stamp specification.
;;
;; * Tags (t): The line is interpreted as a space-separated list of tags.
;;
;; IMPORTANT: You should ensure that any messages in this maildir folder that
;; you do not want parsed and captured have subjects beginning with '[org]'
;; (without the quotes). This is to allow for other org commands to send
;; messages to your own address. For instance, my 'email' agenda command will
;; send an email to my own address and I don't want my agenda captured to a
;; note! I have a server-side rule that moves such messages into a separate
;; folder called 'org-messages'.
